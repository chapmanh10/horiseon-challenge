## Helping you improve your online business and accessibility

This repository will demonstrate the changes I have made to the original code given to me by UNCC Coding Bootcamp.

Within this repository you will see I was able to: 
-Consolidate and arrange the CSS in a way that is more user friendly and increase legibility. 
-Give the HTML proper syntax in a way that divides the document to increase legibility.
-Ensure all of the application links function properly.
-Apply appropriate alt attributes for screen readers.
